# python-challenge

Python scripting was used to analysed 2 csv files, budget_data.csv for PyBank and election_data.csv for PyPoll. Each related python files (as main.py) were stored under the main PyBank and PyPoll folder, with the csv files in the Resources folder, and text file output in the analysis folder. 

For PyBank / budget_data.csv file
Python scripting was used to analyse the budget_data.csv for the following:
1. Total number of months included in the dataset
2. Net total amount of "Proft/Losses" over the entire period
3. Month to month changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and overall average
4. Greatest "month to month increase" in "Proft/Losses" over the entire period - with output to month and amount
5. Greatest "month to month decrease" in "Proft/Losses" over the entire period - with output to month and amount

For PyPoll / election_data.csv file
Python scripting was used to analyse the election_data.csv for the following:
1. Total number of votes cast
2. Complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Percentage of votes each candidate had
4. Total number of votes each candidate had
5. Declare the winner of the election based on popular vote
